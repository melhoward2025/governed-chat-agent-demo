GOVERNED CHAT AGENT LOG
======================

Purpose:
This log records proposals made by the chat agent
and whether they were approved or rejected by the human.

Rule:
No output is final unless explicitly approved by the human.


--- ENTRY 001 ---

Task:
High-level synthesis of governance-first architecture.

Decision: Rejected

Reason:
The output was too generic and did not accurately reflect
the specific mechanisms described in the papers.
Key concepts were missing.


--- ENTRY 002 ---

Task:
Revised synthesis of governance-first architecture with explicit mechanisms.

Decision: Rejected

Reason:
Although core concepts were named, the synthesis remains too generic.
It does not faithfully reflect the architectural rigor, enforcement logic,
or interaction between mechanisms described in the papers.



--- ENTRY 003 ---

Task:
Structured synthesis of governance-first architecture with enforced mechanisms.

Decision: Approved

Notes:
This synthesis accurately reflects the core architectural mechanisms
described in the papers, including separation of cognition and authority,
fail-closed safety gates, authority tokens, commitment semantics,
reachability-based safety, and structural self-governance.
Approved as a canonical high-level architecture description.



--- ENTRY 004 ---

Task:
Simplified public explanation of governance-first architecture.

Decision: Rejected

Reason:
The explanation is simplified to the point of inaccuracy
and does not preserve the enforcement semantics of the architecture.


--- ENTRY 005 ---

Task:
Public-facing explanation of governance-first architecture.

Decision: Approved

Notes:
This explanation preserves the core control and safety properties
while remaining understandable to a general audience.
